## Installation

Download and install **Smart Home System.apk** onto your Android smartphone to try the application. You can use **u1** for user name and **p1** for password. Note that the system connected to a temporary Firebase database. If you want to use the app with full functionality, generate your own Firebase database and connect it to the Android project: https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup (You can figure out what should be database variables from the code.)


## Connection to a Real Hardware

If you want to connect the application to a real hardware, you can use Arduino. In Arduino, use the same firebase to provide interconnection between the hardware and the software.
